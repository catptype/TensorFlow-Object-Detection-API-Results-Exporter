# TensorFlow Object Detection API Results Exporter

This Python project is created to facilitate the export of object detection results, including images with Region of Interest (ROI) annotations and XML data.
It utilizes portions of [Tensorflow object detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection), an open-source project developed by the TensorFlow team at Google, which is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0.

I have not modified code and have only imported modules directly for the purpose of object detection.
For more information about [Tensorflow object detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) and its license, please visit  [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/LICENSE).
